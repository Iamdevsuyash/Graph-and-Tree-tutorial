# 🌳 Graphs & Trees Tutorial – Python Implementation

This repository contains a hands-on and beginner-friendly tutorial on understanding and implementing various graph and tree-related concepts in Python. It uses **adjacency list**, **matrix**, and **edge list** formats with clean and readable code.

---

## 🔧 Topics Covered

### ✅ Graph Basics
- Representations: Adjacency List, Matrix, and Edge List
- Degree of Vertices
- Graph Conversion Utility

### ✅ Graph Types & Properties
- Check if two nodes are adjacent
- Is the graph complete?
- Is the graph connected?
- Detecting cycles in a graph
- Spanning Tree (Directed & Undirected)

### ✅ Tree Properties
- Check if a graph is a tree
- Count the number of **leaf nodes**
- Check if a tree is a **binary tree**
- Find the **height** of a tree
- Find the **depth** of a node

### ✅ Graph Traversal & Classification
- Identify if a given sequence is a:
  - **Walk**
  - **Trail**
  - **Path**

## ▶️ Getting Started

Just run the Python file:

```bash
python graphs_and_trees.py
```

Make sure to update or input your custom graph structures in the format shown in the examples.

## 🧠 Notes

- All implementations are **from scratch**, with no external libraries (except `collections`).
- This project is educational, meant to help you **understand the logic and structure** of graphs and trees.
- Works well for school/university-level DSA understanding and interview prep.
